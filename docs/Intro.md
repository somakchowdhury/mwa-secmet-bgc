# Introduction

This workflow documentation explains how a moving window analysis can be done on a pair of protein sequences to ascertain start points of diversification or recombination. 

The use case here is modules of secondary metabolite producing genes. These modules contain protein domains which serve specific role in synthesis of natural products. 

## Prerequisites for the Workflow

 - A linux/Unix sub-system
 - Initialised miniconda package manager [link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)
 - Jupyter installed in the base environment of miniconda with bash kernel. 
 - Install BASH kernel for jupyter with following commands - 
 ```
 pip install bash_kernel
 python -m bash_kernel.install
 ```

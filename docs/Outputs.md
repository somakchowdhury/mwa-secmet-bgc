# Expected Outputs

Four unnumbered output folders will be created at the end of the workflow.

```
mwa-secmet-bgc
|___aligned_pairs/
|___fragmented_pairs/
|___blast_out/
|___result_plots/
|___result_tables/
```

The `results_plot/` contains pairwise graphs of the compared sequences with appropriate titles for subject and query


The `result_tables/` contains modified and filtered blast output tables that were used to produce the plots.

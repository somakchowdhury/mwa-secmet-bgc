# Workflow Initialisation 

## Step 1: Getting the files

- Navigate to the directory where analysis needs to be conducted
```
 cd path/to/your/dir 
``` 
- Clone this repository in that directory
```
git clone https://github.com/somakchowdhury/mwa-secmet-bgc.git 
```

## Step 2: Access the `.ipynb` notebook to start workflow

- Navigate to `mwa-secmet-bgc` folder
```
cd mwa-secmet-bgc/
```
- Then run this command
```
jupyter notebook
```
- In the browser open the jupyter notebook file `.ipynb`

Follow through the steps listed in the workflow to obtain the desired output files. The input files can be changed. Only condition is that they should contain only a pair of fasta sequences.
